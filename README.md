# About

The EBU Core Plus defines an ontology that is published at https://github.com/ebu/ebucoreplus. The ontology is described
in OWL format. This repository uses sources taken from https://github.com/piscisaureus/owl2java to generate Java classes
out of it which later can be used to speed up initial implementations of the domain models of SRF Launch.
